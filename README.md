This project provided a hands-on exploration of binary search trees and their practical use in information retrieval. The experience deepened my understanding of core concepts. 
Creating the BST involved getting into the details of maintaining the binary search property,
ensuring that each node's key was in the right spot among its left and right children. 
This highlighted the importance of efficient tree traversal and using recursive algorithm
